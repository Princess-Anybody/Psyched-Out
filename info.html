    <h3>What is mental illness?</h3>
<p>Mental illnesses are conditions that affect a person’s thinking, feeling, mood or behavior, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. Such conditions may be occasional or long-lasting (chronic) and affect someone’s ability to relate to others and function each day.
</p>

<br>

<h3>What is mental health?</h3>
<p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices.
Although the terms are often used interchangeably, poor mental health and mental illness are not the same thing. A person can experience poor mental health and not be diagnosed with a mental illness. Likewise, a person diagnosed with a mental illness can experience periods of physical, mental, and social well-being.
</p>

<br>

<h3>Why is mental health important for overall health?</h3>
<p>Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health.  Mental illness, especially depression, increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like stroke, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.

<br>


<h3>Can your mental health change over time?</h3>
<p>Yes, depending on many factors.  When the demands placed on a person exceed their resources and coping abilities, their mental health could be impacted.
</p>

<br>

<h3>How common are mental illnesses?</h3>
<p>Mental illnesses are among the most common health conditions in the United States.
<ul>More than 50% will be diagnosed with a mental illness or disorder at some point in their lifetime.</ul>
<ul>1 in 5 children, either currently or at some point during their life, have had a seriously debilitating mental illness.</ul>
<ul>1 in 25 Americans live with a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression.</ul>
</p>

<br>

<h3>What causes mental illness?</h3>
<p>There is no single cause for mental illness. A number of factors can contribute to risk for mental illness, such as:

<ul>Early adverse life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse.</ul>
<ul>Experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical condition, such as cancer or diabetes.</ul>
<ul>Biological factors, such as genes or chemical imbalances in the brain.</ul>
